#hello

you have notice that this repo has two folders, the software wirtten in both of these files is for the same api "DailyPlanner",
deploying the first folder which is now "new folder" resulted in a lot off crashes due to "module name not found" and so i decided to start 
a clean slate and successfully deployed my api. Reason why I keep the second one is for ALX to see my commits.

kind regards
